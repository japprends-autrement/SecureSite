# SecureSite
A way to help to securize your website : allow just the connexions that you want ...

To securize our website, we choose different methods. One of them is very simple ; our website (www.japprends-autrement.be) is only in french language, 
so the non french-speaking countries don't have access to it. 

Unfortunately, to promote our website, we must allow some bot from well known compagnies (google, microsoft, facebook, amazon).

We try to set up php code to allow only french speaking countries and to check ip adresses for a time to identify the important ip from non french speaking countries to allow.
